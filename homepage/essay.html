          <h1>The Essay</h1>
            <p>“This is Myrtle Wyckoff Avenue”. I went onto hearing that until I was about 13 years old. I grew up in Myrtle Wyckoff and it was a very lively place to grow up at. Right next to my apartment building was a car shop, taxi place, barbershop, and a little restaurant, and all these things came to life at night.</p>
            <p>Loud music would play from cars and the sound of laughter and talking would fill up the streets as the night went on. They would be huddled in groups eating empanadas and drinking lemonade or some other drink talking and laughing until the occasional M train made itself known on the elevated train track that towered over the streets of Myrtle. But this was an every night thing and made me feel rather comfortable. It was the feeling of knowing that as I slept, there were still people out there enjoying their time while unknowingly keeping me company as I went to bed, making me feel safe.</p>
            <p>And every morning I would wake up for school and at 7:15 I would wait and watch the “Your World In 90 Seconds” because it was just something that made my morning my morning. I would also go downstairs and say hi to the owner of the car shop, I never knew his real name so I just called him Papi, and I’d say hi to the guy at the deli on the corner of my block as I bought something to drink with my mom and go on with my day.</p>
            <p>However, now that I moved, I don’t really feel the same. There is no train and laughter to fill the night and there is no one like Papi or the deli guy. It’s just quiet and dark. I go back to visit sometimes because I hang out with some friends in the area and all of them remember me, the deli guy says hi and the guy that worked at the taxi place remembered me and asked how I was. Papi’s shop isn’t open anymore though. Myrtle Wyckoff isn’t like most of the neighborhoods that people live in. Even the neighborhood I live in now isn’t anywhere close to it. At Myrtle, Everyone knew everyone and it was just constantly alive and it was like those movies where people would go about their morning and say good morning to everyone because they knew each other. Now it's just going about your business and just getting to where you need to go and going back home.</p>
            <p>Myrtle Wyckoff is and always will be a place that I can look back at and appreciate it because it was a time that I want to go back to and relive because it’s hard to find a place like it. It’s just open armed to the people that come in and the community there was built over years and years of just growing there with one another.  The memories that I made there will always be something I can smile back at and I can also count on going back there so I can just say hi to the people that help make Myrtle Wycoff the place that it was and is.  This is what Myrtle Wyckoff is and it will always be a reliable place to go to for anything.</p>
